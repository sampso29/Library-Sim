The script to be run is in the Menu Class. To add a book type: STAFF, the type: ADD A BOOK.
The system is not case-sensitive, except for usernames of students.

Assumptions of the system:
1) a student cannot take multiple copies of the same book out of the library
2) a user will not go "back in time"/ users will only enter dates that are after dates they already entered
3) fees are charged once the book is returned
